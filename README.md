## Notes

- This is an experimental repo, I am new to react so I am exploring, breaking and learning. Expect this repo to be refactored, changed & occasionaly broken. 
- This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Below you will find some information on how to perform common tasks.<br>
